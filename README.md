# Global Literacy Rate in the 90s

## Literacy Rates Per Year From 1990-1999 by Sex and Region

## Final Project for Elijah Holt

### Process:

Via the world bank website, I first selected what topic of data I wanted (agriculture, GDP, government, etc.) and chose education. Then I was given the option to choose what kind of education data I wanted. This was the most difficult part. There were over 3000 options of data points to choose from. For example, there was Percent Retention Grade 1, Percent Retention Grade 1 Male, Percent Retention Grade 1 Urban, etc. There were more types of data on education than I had considered, from teacher salary to number of kids to a textbook. I decided to focus on literacy rate because it had very accessible data that was easy to understand what each point was: total, male, female. Then I had to select what years I wanted the data for. Not only did it include data from 1970 onwards, there were also options for future projections, like 2040 or 2065. Since I am interested in history, I decided to focus on the 90s. So now I had 10 years of 3 data points. Next I had to choose which part of the world. It would be counterproductive to choose every country, as that’s too much data for the scope of this assignment. There was an option to select aggregates, which at first I thought meant if you selected North America, say, it would give you the data for each country in North America. But instead it’s the data point for the literacy rate of all of North America. I decided to focus on comparing data by continent, but this was easier said than done. There were multiple versions of some regions like East Asian lower income countries versus East Asia versus East Asia excluding high income countries. There were also overlapping regions/continents. There would be Europe and Central Asia, Euro Area, Central Europe & Baltics, European Union, and more. This was true for most every region of the world, though to a lesser degress than Europe. Eventually I narrowed it down to what I thought was the best representation of the regions of the globe - though some overlap, like Southeast Asia and Pacific Nations. I thought it was better to be more thorough than not, so erred on the side of overlap rather than risk gaps.

### Below are screenshots of what the process of selecting what data I wanted was like:

I went through each region’s data set, looking through the values to make sure there were no wild outliers. This was really easy to do manually using the World Bank Data tools, as it automatically produced a line chart of literacy rate over the years for each separate region.

I could simply look over them to see if there were any notable differences or spikes. I ran into some problems with, surprisingly enough, data from Europe and North America. There wasn’t any data for North America and the European Union. Europe and Central Asia only had data from 1995 onwards. So, I went to reevaluate what regions I had chosen. There was one called “Euro Area,” and in lieu of North America I selected the United States. I also decided to include China and Russia for comparison purposes as they are both large enough to constitute their own region of the globe. Russia didn’t have any data, and China only had 1990, which was unhelpful.

Eventually I added every region that said “euro” in it, plus the United States and Canada for North America. Just for good measure I also added the United Kingdom, France, and Germany to manufacture some sort of representation to Europe, as those are the most (in my understanding) economically powerful countries in Europe. What I ended up with was:
* No data for the USA or Canada
* No data for Russia (still)
* Partial data for China 
* No data for the European Union or Euro Area
* Partial data for Europe and Central Asia
* Full data and the data I am keeping for: Middle East & North Africa; South Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa; Central Europe and the Baltics; Arab World; East Asia & Pacific; Latin America and Caribbean; “Europe and Central Asia Excluding High Income”; “Europe and Central Asia IDA & IBRD Countries"; World

### Regions I ultimately selected:
